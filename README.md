Smart PIP is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your YouTube viewing experience by automating the activation of Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode for videos. Picture-in-Picture mode allows videos to play in a floating window that stays on top of other content, enabling you to continue watching videos while multitasking on other tasks or browsing different websites.
